I notice that you've only provided the contents of `MostlyAI/mostlyai-main/mostlyai/sdk/py.typed` which is empty, but the AI's response is trying to modify `src/data/canonicalData.ts` and `src/types/freight.ts`. 

Without seeing the original contents of `src/data/canonicalData.ts`, I cannot provide the full code with the AI's modifications properly integrated. The AI only mentioned fixing line 1081 by converting a string to a number (`weight_kg: 150`), but I need to see the complete original file to replace the `// ... keep existing code` comments with the actual existing code.

Could you please provide the original contents of `src/data/canonicalData.ts` so I can write out the full modified code?
